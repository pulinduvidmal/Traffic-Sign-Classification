# Traffic-Sign-Classification

Traffic sign classification is an important task for self-driving cars. In this project, we will train a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify traffic sign images.

## Introduction

The ability to accurately recognize and classify traffic signs is crucial for autonomous vehicles to navigate safely on roads. This project aims to develop a robust CNN model capable of identifying various traffic signs with high accuracy.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains images of 43 different classes of traffic signs. Each class represents a specific type of traffic sign commonly found on roads. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets to facilitate model training and evaluation.
